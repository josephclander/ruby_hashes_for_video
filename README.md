# Ruby Hashes Playground

There is an accompanying video for this playground on my YouTube channel [_splat_bang_](https://youtu.be/-KHz2Ry2wHw).

## How to use

Download the files and from your terminal run:

```shell
bundle install
```

To run autosave and generate as I do in the video run:

```shell
rubymon hashes.rb
```

You are now in `watchmode`. The next time you save that filename will execute automatically. For this reason you will need to turn off autosave features so it only renders when you are ready.
